    <h1>Privacy Policy for Extract Text from Image Extension</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: [Date]</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Extract Text from Image Chrome extension. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our extension. Our extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. It only processes the images you upload locally on your device and extracts text from those images. The extracted text is stored temporarily in the extension's local storage and is never sent to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party services that collect or process personal data. The Tesseract.js library used for text extraction operates entirely on your device and does not communicate with external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is no data to secure outside of your device. We are committed to ensuring that your data remains secure and private.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or our extension, please contact us at [your_email@example.com].</p>
